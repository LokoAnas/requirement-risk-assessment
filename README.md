# SmartRisk Learner

**SmartRisk Learner** is a machine learning project designed to perform advanced risk assessment using fine-tuned models and ensemble learning techniques. It leverages tools like `scikit-learn`, `scikit-optimize`, and `skops` to achieve optimized and interpretable model performance.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Ensemble modeling for improved generalization
- 🔍 Hyperparameter optimization using `scikit-optimize`
- 📊 Comprehensive evaluation with ROC, precision-recall, F1, etc.
- 💾 Model saving/loading with `skops`
- ⚙️ Compatible with various ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)


## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install scikit-learn scikit-optimize skops
```

## 🧪 Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook risk-assessment-ensemble-model-and-other-fine-tuned-models.ipynb
```

### Notebook Workflow

1. Data preprocessing & feature encoding
2. Model training and evaluation
3. Hyperparameter tuning using randomized/grid search
4. Ensemble techniques applied
5. Performance visualization and metrics reporting
6. Model export using `skops`

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC AUC
* Confusion Matrix

## 💾 Saving Models

Models are serialized using `skops` for better portability and HuggingFace compatibility:

```python
import skops.io as sio
sio.dump(model, "model.skops")
```
